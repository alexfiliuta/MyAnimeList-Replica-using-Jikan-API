# MyAnimeList Replica

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a replica (although not similar) of MyAnimeList, a popular anime database and community website. It utilizes the Jikan API to fetch anime data and is built using React.

## Features

- **Browse Popular, Airing, and Upcoming Anime**: Users can view lists of anime categorized into popular, airing, and upcoming.
- **Detailed Anime Information**: Each anime page provides detailed information such as synopsis, rating, score, trailer and characters.
- **Character Details**: Users can click on characters to see more detailed information and pictures.
- **Responsive Search**: The application includes a search function that allows users to search for anime based on titles.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For navigation within the application.
- **Jikan API**: Used for data state management across the application.
- **CSS**: For styling.

## Setup

First, clone the repository on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexfiliuta/MyAnimeList-Replica-using-Jikan-API.git
cd myAnimeList-Replica-using-Jikan-API
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
